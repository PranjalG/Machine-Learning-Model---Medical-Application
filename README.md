ABOUT THE PROJECT

Using an Artificial Neural Network, we predicted the outcome of binary classification problem to find whether a person is diabetic. We used the dataset from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to diagnostically predict the possibility of diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset,  through a user-friendly interface and store user data for future reference.
